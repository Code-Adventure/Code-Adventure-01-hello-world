# Hello-World Code Game

This is nothing hard to do. Just a hello-world code game to get things rolling.

## Installation instructions

You need Ruby installrd for running this. And Bundler. If you do not have bundler installed, install it by typing

`gem install bundler`

Next, change into the directory of the repository. Then install dependencies by typing

`bundle install --path vendor/bundle`

## The game

You have to solve a code-puzzle. There are tests included, that will tell you, what to do. Run the tests with:

`bundle exec rspec`

The tests are red, you mission is, to make them all pass. So to turn them green.
